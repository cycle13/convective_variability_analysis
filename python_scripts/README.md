# python_scripts - Data processing and plotting

This directory contains all the Python scripts to process the raw data and produce figures.

The scripts are all designed (with the exception of `helpers.py` which contains additional functions for the other scripts) to be called from the command line with arguments. Type `-h` to show the arguments.

Note that I am using an Anaconda environent. The details are specified in the log file.

The table below lists the files plots and options:

| File | Plots |
|------|-------|
| `prec_stats.py` | Precipitation frequency histogram |
|                 | Cloud size and cloud precipitation sum distributions |
|                 | Precipitation radial distribution function |
